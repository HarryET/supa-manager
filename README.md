# SupaManager
A project by Harry Bairstow;<br/>
Manage self-hosted Supabase instances using the Supabase studio.

<hr />

> [!WARNING]
> The project is in active development and as such there are no docs for it, the best thing todo is wait for the project to become more stable. I am in the Supabase discord, however, the best way to reach me is via [my discord server](https://discord.gg/4k5HRe6YEp) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/TheHarryET)

This project is only an API that has to be used in conjunction with the Supabase Studio or another UI. It is a fully functioning API which is based on what Supabase us in production and have as a mock in the Studio project. Please read the guides - when they are available - for information on how to start Supabase's Studio using this as the API.

> [!NOTE]
> We provide a way to patch a version of the Supabase Studio to use this API. Please refer to the `studio` folder for more information.
