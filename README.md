# SupaManager
A project by Harry Bairstow;<br/>
Manage self-hosted Supabase instances with an easy to use API & Web Portal (soon)

<hr />

> ⚠️ **Note:** The project is in active development and as such there are no docs for it, the best thing todo is wait for the project to become more stable. I am in the Supabase discord, however, the best way to reach me is via [my discord server](https://discord.gg/4k5HRe6YEp).
